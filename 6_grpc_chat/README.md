***Chatting it up Live***

Welp, it's that time. You trudged through this pile of readme's and pecked all the code into the necessary files. Now, we'll need to test it. To do so, you'll need to start multiple node apps at once. First, open a terminal or command prompt window and start your server by running:

```
node server.js
```

Confirm you don't have any errors before you start your client. If you need help troubleshooting ask around or reach out to an organizer. 

Then two or more *NEW* terminal or command prompt windows, and start up some clients.

```
node client.js
```

Give each client a different name and type a few messages and hit enter. You will see your messages instanteously pop up on the other terminal window. Congrats! You've just built a gRPC powered chat. 

Now what? Help a friend! Build a client using a completely different language like Java, Go, or Ruby. Also consider teaming up with some people around you by connecting multiple machines to the same server! (Note: This may require some firewall manipulation.)
