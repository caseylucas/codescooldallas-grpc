CodesCoolDallas-gRPC Workshop
=============================

***Now what?***

Help a friend! Build a client using a completely different language like Java, Go, or Ruby. Also consider teaming up with some people around you by connecting multiple machines to the same server! (Note: This may require some firewall manipulation.)

***Feeling Even More Adventurous***

The power of gRPC is that you can integrate easily with any supported language. The way gRPC handles the transfer of data actually makes some compiled languages like Java even more efficient than JavaScript! 

Want an even stronger challenge? Try building a client to interact with your chat using another gRPC language such as Go, Java, or Python and share with the group!

Thanks for coming to NodeSchool and don't forget to register your attendance on the GitHub issue!
