CodesCoolDallas-gRPC Workshop
=============================

***So what is gRPC?***

gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.

***Cool, what is it good for?***

* Low latency, highly scalable, distributed systems.
* Developing mobile clients which are communicating to a cloud server.
* Designing a new protocol that needs to be accurate, efficient and language independent.
* Layered design to enable extension eg. authentication, load balancing, logging and monitoring etc.

***Nice, and Who uses it?***

Most importantly, ParkHub. :D Other users of gRPC you may have heard of include Square, Netflix, Cisco, and Docker. You can read more about who is using it and for what purposes on [grpc.io](https://grpc.io/).

***Awesome, so what are we going to do with it?***

We're going to a quick, simple Node gRPC tutorial from a blog written by [FEXCO Technology Solutions](https://techblog.fexcofts.com/2018/07/20/grpc-nodejs-chat-example/). The majority of content has been pulled from the blog and simply formatted into any easy to read clonable directory. 

By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to see gRPC in use in a live chat application.
